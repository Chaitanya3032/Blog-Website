        <p class="font1">This article is about Earth's sky. For other skies, see extraterrestrial skies. For other uses,
            see Sky (disambiguation).

            The sky above the clouds
            The sky (also sometimes called celestial dome) is everything that lies above the surface of the Earth,
            including the atmosphere and outer space.

            In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere,
            concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial
            sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.

            Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and
            usage can vary. An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a
            dome (sometimes called the sky bowl) appearing flatter during the day than at night.[1] In some cases, such
            as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere.

            The daytime sky appears blue because air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight more than longer
            ones (redder light).[2][3][4][5] The night sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with
            stars. The Sun and sometimes the Moon are visible in the daytime sky unless obscured by clouds. At night,
            the Moon, planets, and stars are similarly visible in the sky.

            Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation
            are also visible in the sky. Certain birds and insects, as well as human inventions like aircraft and kites,
            can fly in the sky. Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are
            often seen above large cities.

            Except for direct sunlight, most of the light in the daytime sky is caused by scattering, which is dominated
            by a small-particle limit called Rayleigh scattering. The scattering due to molecule-sized particles (as in
            air) is greater in the directions both toward and away from the source of light than it is in directions
            perpendicular to the incident path.[7] Scattering is significant for light at all visible wavelengths, but
            is stronger at the shorter (bluer) end of the visible spectrum, meaning that the scattered light is bluer
            than its source: the Sun. The remaining direct sunlight, having lost some of its shorter-wavelength
            components, appears slightly less blue.[5]

            Scattering also occurs even more strongly in clouds. Individual water droplets refract white light into a
            set of colored rings. If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the
            set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.[clarification needed][8]

            The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple, and yellow (especially near sunset or
            sunrise) when the light must travel a much longer path (or optical depth) through the atmosphere. Scattering
            effects also partially polarize light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90Â° from the Sun.
            Scattered light from the horizon travels through as much as 38 times the air mass as does light from the
            zenith, causing a blue gradient looking vivid at the zenith and pale near the horizon.[9] Red light is also
            scattered if there is enough air between the source and the observer, causing parts of the sky to change
            color as the Sun rises or sets. As the air mass nears infinity, scattered daylight appears whiter and
            whiter.[10]

            The Sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in the atmosphere. Distant clouds or snowy
            mountaintops may appear yellowish. The effect is not very obvious on clear days, but is very pronounced when
            clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.[10] At higher altitudes, the
            sky tends toward darker colors since scattering is reduced due to lower air density. An extreme example is
            the Moon, where no atmospheric scattering occurs, making the lunar sky black even when the Sun is
            visible.[11]

            Sky luminance distribution models have been recommended by the International Commission on Illumination
            (CIE) for the design of daylighting schemes. Recent developments relate to "all sky models" for modelling
            sky luminance under weather conditions ranging from clear to overcast.[12]
