        <p class="font1">Inaugurated in 2010, the Burj Khalifa is the tallest structure and building in the world. The
            total height is at 829.8 m and the roof height is 828 m.

            <div class="center" ><h2>History</h2></div></p><br>
            <p class="font1">The construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004 and it was completed five years later in 2009. In 2010
            the building launched as part of a new plan named downtown Dubai. It is planned to be the cornerstone of
            large, mixed-use development. The building set several records in height, including its listing as the
            world’s tallest structure. Burj Khalifa was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill’s Adrian Smith, whose
            company previously designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Centre.</p><br>

            <div class="center" ><h2>Significant Features</h2></div><br>
            <h3>The Dubai Fountain</h3><br>
            <p class="font1">The Dubai Fountain is a majestic piece of art situated right outside the Burj Khalifa. It is Illuminated by
            6,600 lights and 50 colored projectors. A range of classical to contemporary Arabic and other music is
            constantly played in the area. It has the capability to shoot water 150 m into the air.</p><br>

          

            <h3> Observation deck</h3><br>
            <p class="font1">Named At The Top, The Observation Deck in Burj Khalifa was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world
            at the time of opening. The current record is held by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower. The observation
            deck also features the electronic telescope, an virtual reality system created by Montréal’s Gsmprjct °
            allowing tourists to experience the natural scenery in real-time. When the tide is low and the visibility is
            high, people can see Iran’s shores from the top of the skylights</p><br>

            <h3> Burj Khalifa Park</h3><br>
            <p class="font1">Burj Khalifa is surrounded by a 27-acre park designed by SWA Group landscape architects. Like the tower
            itself, the design of the park has been inspired by the Hymenocallis flower, a desert plant. At the heart of
            the property is the water field, a series of ponds, and water jet fountains.</p><br>

            <div class="center" ><h2> Things to Do</h2></div><br>
            <p class="font1">The Burj Khalifa offers a wide range of options for the tourists. Visitors get an option to view the
            panoramic view of the area from the observation deck. Alternatively the visitors can also choose to eat your
            heart out at some of Dubai’s finest poshest restaurants.</p><br>

            <div class="center" ><h2> Best time to Visit</h2></div><br>
            <p class="font1">In visitors, Dubai attracts like a flame. The perfect time to visit Dubai is during the winter months,
            November to April. January and February see strong traffic thanks to the Dubai Shopping Festival.
