        <br><p class="font1">Mercedes-Benz has long billed the S-Class as the pinnacle of luxury and performance for the combustion age. It's now intent to do the same with a full-electric sibling.<br>

            <br>The EQS sedan Mercedes will unveil Thursday has a market-leading driving range and luxurious interior rarely found in battery-powered cars. It is meant to usher in a new era for Daimler's main brand, which spent decades designing high-powered combustion cars to drive around captains of industry and heads of state.<br>
            
            <br>Attempts by BMW's 7 Series and Audi's A8 to win over more of those deep-pocketed customers yielded only modest results over the years.<br>
            
            <br>But Tesla's Model S outselling the S-Class in markets including the U.S. proved that the electric shift would not spare the upper echelons of the automotive world.<br>

            <br>"Mercedes claims that the S-Class is the best car in the world, hence the EQS should be the best electric car in the world, and it will most likely be scrutinized with that expectation in mind," said Roman Mathyssek, a consultant at Arthur D. Little. The bar for the Mercedes EQS is "very high in every respect."<br>
            
            <br>Criticized for taking too long to embrace EVs, Daimler is under pressure to prove it can retain its engineering prowess in the electric age, where expertise in battery technology and software is key.<br>

            </p>
            
            <p class="font1"> <br> Tesla is strengthening the Model S with a fresh performance version and new rivals like Lucid Motors Inc. are plotting inroads into the lucrative luxury segment that is still largely dominated by Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Toyota's Lexus.<br>
            
            <br>The EQS, which features an optional digital panel stretching across the entire dashboard, will be the first Mercedes built on a dedicated platform for battery-powered cars. It does away with the engineering compromises that earned the brand's first EV, the EQC SUV, criticism from Tesla aficionados and Mercedes loyalists alike.<br>
       
            <br>While the praise should come as a boon to Mercedes, it remains to be seen how well the EQS will sell and -- more importantly -- if it can win over more Tesla customers than it lures away from the highly profitable S-Class.<br>

            <br>Volumes of the EQS "will depend heavily on the price point versus competition," UBS Group AG analysts led by Patrick Hummel said in a note, adding that they expect the electric model to cost more than a comparable S-Class.<br>
            
            <br>"While the vehicle is unlikely to challenge the performance of Tesla Model S, it will likely deliver a better luxury experience."<br>
